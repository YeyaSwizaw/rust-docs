The coherent noise source provides no customisation and is very simple, and mainly exists to be used by the perlin source, which is the recommended one to use at the moment.These generators provide a method for generating a noise value at a specific location, however are best used in combination with a `NoiseMap`"],["noisemap","Generators for finite noise mapsA `NoiseMap` takes a `NoiseProvider` and uses it to generate a map of noise.They have properties that can be set to specify the seed used for noise generation, the size of the generated map, and the scale of the coordinates used for generation.A simple noise map is created by wrapping a source of noise, and then setting the required properties:By default, a noise map will generate values between -1 and 1, however one can be scaled by multiplying it by an integer:This produces a `ScaledNoiseMap`, which multiplies all of its values by the factor when they are generated.Noise maps can also be combined by adding them together:This final result will be normalised back between -1 and 1.Once you have the noise map you want, you can then use it to produce a vector of rows of values:A noise map is essentially an infinite plane of numbers, and the `generate` method produces the central chunk of the size specified. You can use the  `generate_chunk` method to generate specific chunks and produce infinite maps."],["world","For generating maps of specfic objects based on thresholds.Once we have a `NoiseMap` we can use a `World` and generate a map of specific tiles using threshold constraints."]]});
